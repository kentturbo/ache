# Project Title

The idea for the site arose spontaneously, after viewing the site of Russian programmer ache. Inspired by his site I decided to make a remake, but with modern technology and near-modern (in my humble opinion) site. i copied not the entire site, it is only planned. at the moment i have implemented the following:
- the definition of time in Moscow, as well as changing the greeting depending on the time.
- determination of the user's city through yandex api.
- an attempt at adaptivity (not very successful XD)
- change of theme (color palette of light theme is not very well finished)
- border animation (looks cool heh)
- found some cool music in the background (the author allowed it to be inserted, it's ok)
- dropdown menu. 

Before this project I knew nothing about js. It was originally written entirely in php and only then I rewrote and changed it (in fact rewrote).
